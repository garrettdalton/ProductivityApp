# Garrett's Productivity App

My name is Garrett, and this application is the culmination of a year-long journey spent refining my personal workflow and physical training routines. Following an ADHD diagnosis midway through my college career, I became dedicated to researching and testing productivity frameworks to overcome challenges with executive function and sustained motivation. Developed as my final project for the Web Development program at **Lehman College**, this app integrates the strategies that proved most effective in my own academic and personal life.

## Functionality
The application serves as a dynamic task management system designed for both deep work and interval-based physical training. Key features include:

* **Adaptive Task Management:** Users can create and organize tasks using intuitive drag-and-drop functionality or directional controls.
* **Integrated Timers:** Each task features an adjustable countdown, supporting workflows like the **Pomodoro Technique** or custom interval training sets.
* **Smart Sequencing:** The system features an automated "auto-advance" logic. When a timed task concludes, the next begins immediately; however, the system pauses for untimed tasks to allow for flexible breaks or manual transitions.
* **Calendar Integration:** A built-in calendar view ensures that immediate tasks and long-term deadlines remain visible in a single interface.
* **Responsive Design:** The platform is fully optimized for mobile use, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop and handheld devices.

## Technologies
This is a full-stack **PERN** application built with:
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js
* **Frontend:** React
* **Tools & APIs:** Developed in the **Cursor IDE** utilizing AI-assisted pair programming, with integration of the **Google Calendar API**.

## Future Roadmap
The next phase of development focuses on audio-visual synchronization. I am currently exploring the **Spotify API** to enable music playback that reacts to the application's timers. Future updates will allow for automated track changes, pausing, and playlist switching triggered by the completion of specific tasks or rest intervals.
